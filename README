A munin plugin for tracking IMAP message quantities.  Tuned specifically
for gmail, but it can be widged to work with other IMAP servers too.

Install it by calling it /etc/munin/plugins/inboxcount, set your
username and password below, and create symlinks to it from "sendrate",
"spamometer", and "spamrate".  Also, it would probably be a good idea to
chmod 640 and chown root.munin this, since it has your e-mail password
in it.

Restart munin-node and it'll hopefully work.

TODO LIST
---------
* Changelog
* License

* Better installation instructions
* Move configuration to /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d
* Easier support for monitoring multiple mailboxes (perhaps a "total"
  graph as well?)
* More intelligent caching of information
* Make sure that running it as a non-munin user doesn't barf up the /var/run
  dropfile
